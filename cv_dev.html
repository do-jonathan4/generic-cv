            <p>I would like to express my interest for the <span>position</span> position at <span>company</span>. I have spent the last few years of my career practicing medicine in a variety of settings, which has given me hands-on experience for working with patients. I am confident my past experience will be useful for this position.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My experience as a respiratory therapist has made me very detail-oriented and process-driven. While I'm aware I won't exactly be saving lives as a <span>position</span>, I am confident my obsession with detail and ability to communicate will go a long way towards being a productive member of the team.</p>
            <br>
            <p>While I enjoy my time as a respiratory therapist, the combination of career progression and the COVID epidemic gave me a lot of time to reflect. This prompted me to consider other career options.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I started off with freeCodeCamp, teaching myself HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I realized that I wanted to do this professionally and so I enrolled myself at LearningFuze Coding Bootcamp, where I continued to learn and practice <span>languages</span> in addition to building projects.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Working at <span>company</span> as a <span>position</span> would be a dream come true. Your <span>company value</span> matches my interests. I am willing to change and adapt to whatever the role demands of me.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I believe I am a great fit for this role and would appreciate the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to <span>company</span>. I am confident that my previous role in healthcare will translate well to the <span>position</span> role. Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.</p>
