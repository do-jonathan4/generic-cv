            <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
            <p class="break"></p>
            <p>I would like to express my interest for the <span class="position">position</span> position at <span class="company">company</span>. I have spent the last few years of my career practicing medicine in a variety of settings, which has given me hands-on experience for working with patients and other health professionals. I am confident my past experience will be useful for this position.</p>
            <p class="break"></p>
            <p>My experience as a respiratory therapist has made me meticulous and process-driven. While I'm aware I won't exactly be saving lives as a <span class="position">position</span>, I am confident my interest in technology and my obsession with detail and ability to communicate will go a long way towards being a productive member of the team.</p>
            <p class="break"></p>
            <p>I started off with freeCodeCamp, taking introductory HTML, CSS and JavaScript courses. I realized that I wanted to do this professionally and so I enrolled myself at LearningFuze: Web Development program, where I spent about 40 hours a week for a year programming. I continued to learn and practice other languages such as <span class="languages">languages</span> in addition to building projects under the guidance of senior developers.</p>
            <p class="break"></p>
            <p>I am confident that my previous role in healthcare will translate well to the <span class="position">position</span> role where I can help develop solutions and continue learning about software engineering. It would be an honor to be a part of your team, and I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to <span class="company">company</span>. Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.</p>
