            <p>I would like to express my interest for the <span class="position">position</span> position at <span class="company">company</span>. I have spent the last few years of my career practicing medicine in subacute, home health and sleep lab setting, which has given me hands-on experience for working with patients. I have refined my skills in diagnosing and treating pulmonary diseases.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My experience as a respiratory therapist has made me very detail-oriented and process-driven. I am confident my obsession with detail and ability to communicate at the bedside and with coworkers will go a long way towards being a productive member of the team.</p>
            <br>
            <p>While I enjoy my time as a respiratory therapist, the combination of career progression and the COVID epidemic gave me a lot of time to reflect. This prompted me to consider <span class="other">other career options</span>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My education includes an Associate's Degree in Respiratory Therapy and I possess a current license to practice. I believe I am a great fit for this role and would appreciate the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to <span class="company">company</span>. Although I am confident that my past experience will translate well into this role, I am willing to change and adapt to whatever is demanded of me. Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.</p>
